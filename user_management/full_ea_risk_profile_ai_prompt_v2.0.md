Given the EA specification (EA Spec) and a list of parameter-value pairs for each strategy, please extract and infer all risk-relevant parameters and computed values needed for downstream risk and portfolio calculations.

- EA Spec
- [Insert EA Spec table or summary here]

- Stragey Parameter and Values
- [Insert each strategyâ€™s parameter-value pairs as JSON]

- EAs may use different logic for martingale, grid, or fixed lot orders, and may or may not have parameters like Martingala_Pips, SL_Number_Of_Order, MaxLot, Lot_Size, DrawDown_SL_Money, or custom lots/distances.
- If any item is not present, return `null` and explain in the notes.
- For EAs with no martingale/grid component, return an empty martingale_lot_sequence and set all martingale/grid-specific fields to `null`.
- For any strategy with Lot_Size, Lot_Multiplier, MaxLot, and SL_Number_Of_Order (or equivalent), you must calculate the full martingale_lot_sequence:
    - Start from Lot_Size.
    - For each subsequent order, multiply the previous lot by Lot_Multiplier.
    - If any lot would exceed MaxLot, cap it at MaxLot.
    - Stop when the sequence reaches SL_Number_Of_Order.
    - Output the sequence as an array of floats in martingale_lot_sequence.
- If the EA uses a custom lot sequence (Custom_Lot) or custom pip sequence (Custom_Martingala), use those instead of standard logic and explain in both `notes` and `calculation_logic`.
- Only output an empty martingale_lot_sequence if there is truly no martingale or grid logic in the EA.
- Never skip this calculation if standard martingale parameters are present, even if Custom_Lot is null.
- For each strategy, in addition to the standard fields, include:

- `calculation_logic`: (string) A step-by-step explanation or formula used to compute `martingale_lot_sequence`, referencing parameter names and how MaxLot and SL_Number_Of_Order are applied.
  - Example: "Started with Lot_Size=0.01, multiplied each subsequent lot by Lot_Multiplier=1.8, capped each value at MaxLot=5.0, repeated until SL_Number_Of_Order=10 was reached. Sequence: [0.01, 0.018, ...]."
  - If custom or dynamic logic is used, explain how it was applied.

For each strategy, output:

- `strategy_name`: (string) Unique name or set file identifier.
- `martingale_lot_sequence`: (array of floats or empty) The full progression of lots the EA would use for a new signal, based on the current Lot_Size and parameters.
- `Martingala_Pips`: (float or null) Pips between orders; `null` if not used.
- `SL_Number_Of_Order`: (integer or null) Max open orders before stop; `null` if not used.
- `MaxLot`: (float or null) The max lot size per order, or `null` if not capped.
- `Lot_Size`: (float) The initial lot size or equivalent as used by the EA.
- `DrawDown_SL_Money`: (float or null) Max allowed floating loss for close-all, or `null` if not present.
- `Custom_Lot`: (array of floats or null) If a custom lot sequence is specified, output the array, else `null`.
- `Custom_Martingala`: (array of floats or null) If a custom pip sequence is specified, output the array, else `null`.
- `notes`: (string) Any special logic, missing/ambiguous fields, non-standard EA behavior, or how the lot sequence and parameters were determined.
- `calculation_logic`: (string) Step-by-step, parameter-referenced explanation of how the sequence was calculated, including capping and stop conditions.

- Do **not** include `Pip value` or `Kelly cap` in the output, as these come from your lookup table/risk model.

**Output Format:**
Return a JSON array, one object per strategy. Example:

- **Return only the JSON array.**
- If you cannot determine a value for any field, set it to `null` and explain in `notes`.
- If the EA uses custom or dynamic logic, describe it in both `notes` and `calculation_logic`.
