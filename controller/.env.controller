MAX_ATTEMPTS=5
# Maximum number of times a task (job or fine-tune) will be retried upon failure
# If a task reaches this number of attempts (attempt_count >= max_attempts), it is marked as 'failed' and not retried again.
# This prevents infinite retry loops for tasks with persistent errors.

MAX_FINE_TUNE_DEPTH=3
# Maximum depth of fine-tune chains (parent → child → ... → fine-tune)
# If a task's fine-tune depth exceeds this value, further fine-tuning is stopped and lineage halts.
# Ensures that the system does not pursue diminishing returns or infinite optimization chains.

DISTANCE_THRESHOLD=0.05
# The normalized distance-to-good threshold for a task to be considered "optimal" or "good enough"
# When a task's result achieves a distance below this value, its status is set to 'completed_success'.
# Used in early stopping logic to prevent unnecessary further fine-tuning when optimality is reached.

SCORE_THRESHOLD=0.90
# The weighted score threshold for a task to be considered a "success"
# When a task's score exceeds this value (and other criteria, if any), its status is set to 'completed_success'.
# Also used for early stopping and to determine if fine-tuning should continue.

AGING_FACTOR=1.2
# The rate at which waiting ('new') tasks' priorities increase over time (aging/fairness)
# Higher values mean that tasks waiting longer in the queue will get their priority boosted more quickly,
# ensuring fairness and avoiding starvation of new tasks.
